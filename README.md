# NID Card OCR Extractor

Welcome to the NID Card OCR Extractor project. This tool is designed to automatically extract key information from National ID cards. Itâ€™s ideal for organizations needing fast and accurate identity verification without manual data entry.

## Features

- **Accurate Extraction**: Automatically retrieves names, birth dates, and ID numbers from NID card images.
- **Image Enhancement**: Processes and enhances low-quality images to improve OCR accuracy.
- **Simple Web Interface**: View results in real time using a user-friendly API.
- **Integrable API**: Easily integrate the extractor into your existing systems.
- **Powered by EasyOCR**: Utilizes the latest EasyOCR models for exceptional performance.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nid-ocr-project.git
   cd nid-ocr-project
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment**:

   Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to see the API running.

## Using the API

You can integrate the API into your own applications. Here is an example of how to send a request using Python:

```python
import requests

# Path to your NID card image
card_image = "path/to/nid_image.jpg"

url = "http://localhost:5000/process_image"

with open(card_image, "rb") as image_file:
    files = {"image": image_file}
    data = {
        "Name": "John Doe",
        "Date of Birth": "01 Jan 1990"
    }
    response = requests.post(url, data=data, files=files)

nid_data = response.json()
print("Extracted Information:")
print(f"Name: {nid_data['Name']}")
print(f"Date of Birth: {nid_data['Date of birth']}")
print(f"ID Number: {nid_data['ID Number']}")
```

## Customization

You can tailor the extractor to better fit your needs:

- **GPU Support**: If you have a compatible GPU, adjust the EasyOCR configuration in the code to enable GPU acceleration.
- **Preprocessing Parameters**: Modify the preprocessing settings to handle different image qualities.
- **Threshold Adjustments**: Fine-tune the detection thresholds to improve accuracy based on your specific dataset.
